======================
LpOD 0.9.1 aka Granada
======================

lpOD -- languages & platforms OpenDocument.
Definition of a Free Software API implementing the ISO/IEC 26300 standard.
Development, for higher level use cases, in Python, Perl and Ruby languages.
of a top-down oriented API.

This release has seen Restructured Text support much improved, and a Gentoo
ebuild was contributed. Packaging of lpOD was a bit improved too and now it's
publised on Pypi [#]_.

A effort was made to remove ODF 1.2 traces from the templates, because lpOD
targets ODF 1.1 for now. ODF 1.2 is not published yet.

Low-level API
=============

- "get_style" and "get_style_list" callable from any element.
- "odf_container.get_contents" renamed to "get_parts"
- "odf_document.get_files" renamed to "get_parts"
- "odf_document.get_file_data" renamed to "get_part"

High-level API
==============

- To get a style by its display name, call::

    context.get_style(family, display_name=u"My Style")

  It was previously a boolean flag.

- In meta part, "(g|s)et_keyword" were renamed to "(g|s)et_keywords" to
  illustrate the possibility of assigning several keywords. ;-) But it still
  takes a single unicode string.

- In meta part, added "(g|s)et_comments" as an alias to "(g|s)et_description"
  because some desktop applications call them like this.

- Table cells gained a "(g|s)et_cell_formula" method. Yes, formulas begin to be
  taken into consideration!
